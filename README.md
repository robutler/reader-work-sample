# READER WORK SAMPLE

## Setup

Requirements: Node.js 0.10.x or highter. Bower (npm install -g bower). Grunt (npm install -g grunt-cli).

Run `npm install && bower install` from the command line to install dependencies.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview. Distribution build can be previewed by running `grunt serve:dist`.

Note that the distribution build still requires the proxy connection to DN.se to allow the http requests to get through.
